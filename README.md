# Unreal_UtilityAI
An Unreal Engine 5 project implementing utility ai with C++

The premise of this mini game is that you are a character confined to a balcony from which to shoot enemies. These enemies come in swarms and respond to the enviroment and to the player.

The enemies in this game have a list of actions they can take with considerations as to which direction do they move. 

Actions:
  - Move towards the player
  - Move towards distraction
  - Move towards cover
  - Wait for companions
  - Take a breather

Each action has considerations that influence whether the action gets done
